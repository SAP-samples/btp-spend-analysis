#Version Two

Subfolders in this directory contain the second version of the SAP Cloud Platform Integration Flows to move data from Ariba Analytical API into SAP Datasphere.  Second Version of the Integration Flows have been parameterized to allow for them to be pointed at different Ariba System Views.  This parameterization means that only a single set of Integration Flows needs to be uploaded into the SAP Cloud Integration Suite.  One Mapping file per Ariba System View will also need to be uploaded for the parameterization to work.  Parameterization is managed via the Configure button on 'step_1' Integration Flow.
