## Description
Power up business content for SAP Analytics Cloud and SAP Ariba Spend Analysis using SAP Integration Suite.

The sample integration flows in this repository demonstrate how to use SAP BTP Integration Suite to pull data from the SAP Ariba Analytical Reporting API, process it into SAP Datasphere, and analyze it using the SAP Analytics Cloud Spend Analysis business content. 

Watch a [high level overview video of the business content](https://share.video.sap.com/media/1_a3htg2ip) that you will be unlocking. 

**Current Position - What is the challenge**
To power up the Ariba Spend Analytics Business Content for Datasphere and SAP Analytics Cloud, you need to move your Ariba data into Datasphere.  Ariba provides an Analytical API for customers to access the data generated by the Spend Analysis entitlement.  Due to the format of the API response, there is no direct ingestion mechanism for Datasphere to pull the Ariba data, therefore some form of ETL tooling needs to be introduced for that data movement.

**Destination - What is the Outcome**
After following this Discovery Mission, you will have deployed the Datasphere and SAP Analytics Cloud Business Content for Spend; you will have deployed the Cloud Integration Suite IFlow into your Business Technology Platform space and used it to move data from your Ariba system into your Datasphere system.


**How you get there - What is the solution**
The solution consists of the prebuilt business content for Datasphere and SAP Analytics Cloud to allow you visibility into your Spend data; a custom Integration Flow that orchestrates the transportation of data from Ariba to Datasphere.
