## Run the Integratio Flow End to End

### Running the Integration Flows:

Once you've configured the whole integration scenario, it's now time to test and see if the data flows end to end. Log into Integration Suite go to the Design tab on the left. Once you click on it selection Integrations and then locate the integration flow you've developed. There is an Actions button on the right side of the screen, click on it and select Deploy.

### Monitoring the Integration Flows:

After running the integration flows, you can go to the Monitor tab on the left. From there you can monitor the integration flows and see if they succeed or fail. If an error pops up you will be able to look into the logs and see what caused the issue. If there isn't an failures/errors then you can be assured the integration flow works.
