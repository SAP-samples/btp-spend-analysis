## Run the Integration Flow End to End

### Running the Integration Flows:

Once you've configured the overall integration scenario, test and verify if the data flow is accomplished end to end. Log in to SAP Integration Suite and go to the **Design** section.  Choose the **Integrations** sub section and select the integration flow you've developed in the previous steps. Deploy the integration flow by clicking **Actions** --> **Deploy**.

### Monitoring the Integration Flows:

After running the integration flows, go to the **Monitor** section.  You can monitor the integration flows and check if they succeed or fail.  If an error is displayed, you are able to look into the logs and find out what what caused the issue.

### Modifying the externalized parameters:

If you need to modify the externalized parameters, please deploy all six flows in order to make sure the changes are up to date.
