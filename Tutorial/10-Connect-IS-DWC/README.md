## Connect Cloud Integration Suite to Data Warehouse Cloud

You will need to create a JDBC connection to Data Warehouse Cloud.  JDBC is the protocol over which the XML blobs are moved to Data Warehouse Cloud. 

Log in to your Business Technology Platform Cockpit and access the Integration Suite.  Design, Develop, and Operate Integration Scenarios.  As in the previous step click on the ‘Eye‘ icon (Monitor), then click on the JDBC Material tile in the Manage Security section.

Name the JDBC connection ‘Data Warehouse Cloud_HANACLOUD’, and fill in the JDBC URL, the User and the Password fields.  That information can be gathered from Data Warehouse Cloud from the Database User Details information box which you access from the info icon to the right of the DB User in the Data Warehouse Cloud Space.
